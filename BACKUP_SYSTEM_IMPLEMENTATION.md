## 🔄 Backup Best Practices

### Recommended Schedule:

1. **Daily Automatic Backups:**
   - Schedule at 2:00 AM (low traffic time)
   - Keep last 7 daily backups

2. **Weekly Manual Backups:**
   - Download via UI every Monday
   - Store in secure location

3. **Before Major Changes:**
   - Always backup before updates
   - Keep pre-update backup separate

4. **Monthly Archive:**
   - Save end-of-month backup
   - Keep for at least 12 months

### Storage Recommendations:

1. **Local Storage:**
   - Keep recent backups on server
   - Set up automatic cleanup (7 days)

2. **Cloud Storage:**
   - Sync to Google Drive/Dropbox
   - Use encrypted storage
   - Enable versioning

3. **Offsite Backup:**
   - Keep critical backups on external drive
   - Store in different physical location
   - Update monthly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openpyxl'"

**Solution:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install openpyxl
# OR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "Backup file not found" (API returns 500)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Insufficient disk space
2. Permission issues
3. Directory doesn't exist

**Solution:**
```bash
cd backend
mkdir -p backups
chmod 755 backups
python manage.py backup_data  # Test manually
```

### Issue: Frontend returns 403 Forbidden

**Cause:** Only admin users can access backup

**Solution:** Login with admin account: `admin` / `Admin@123`

### Issue: Backup takes too long

**Normal:** For 593 records, backup takes ~2-3 seconds

**If slower:**
- Check database connection
- Check server resources
- Try during low-traffic time
