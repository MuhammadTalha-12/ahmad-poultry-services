## üìä Understanding Customer Balances

### Opening Balance
- This is the **initial amount** a customer owed (or you owed them) when you first added them to the system
- Enter **positive number** if customer already owes you money
- Enter **0** if starting fresh

### Closing Balance (Running Balance)
- **Formula**: Opening Balance + Total Sales - Total Payments
- **Positive (Red)**: Customer owes you money
- **Negative (Green)**: You owe customer money (overpaid)
- **Zero (Black)**: All settled up

### Example:
- Customer "Ali Traders"
- Opening Balance: 10,000 PKR (already owed from before)
- Total Sales: 50,000 PKR
- Total Payments: 40,000 PKR
- **Closing Balance**: 10,000 + 50,000 - 40,000 = **20,000 PKR** (Customer owes you)
