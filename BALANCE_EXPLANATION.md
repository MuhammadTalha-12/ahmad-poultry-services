# üí∞ Customer Balance Explanation

## Understanding Opening Balance vs Closing Balance

---

## üìä What are these balances?

### Opening Balance (Initial Debt/Credit)
**What it is:** The amount a customer owed you (or you owed them) when you first started using this system.

**When to use it:**
- You're adding an existing customer who has previous transactions
- Customer already owes you money from before
- You owe customer money (advance payment)

**Examples:**

| Scenario | Opening Balance Value |
|----------|---------------------|
| New customer, no previous debt | `0` |
| Customer owes you 10,000 PKR | `10000` |
| You gave customer 5,000 PKR advance | `-5000` (negative) |
| Customer settled all dues before | `0` |

### Closing Balance (Running Balance / Current Balance)
**What it is:** The **current** amount showing how much the customer owes you (or you owe them).

**Formula:**
```
Closing Balance = Opening Balance + Total Sales - Total Payments
```

**What it means:**
- **Positive (Red)** ‚ûú Customer owes YOU money
- **Negative (Green)** ‚ûú YOU owe customer money (overpaid)
- **Zero (Black)** ‚ûú All settled, no debt either way

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: New Customer
**Customer:** Ali Traders (New customer)

| Field | Value | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Opening Balance | 0 | New customer, no previous transactions |
| Total Sales | 50,000 PKR | Made 2 sales: 20,000 + 30,000 |
| Total Payments | 30,000 PKR | Customer paid 30,000 |
| **Closing Balance** | **20,000 PKR (Red)** | Customer still owes 20,000 |

**Calculation:** 0 + 50,000 - 30,000 = **20,000 PKR**

---

### Example 2: Existing Customer with Previous Debt
**Customer:** Bismillah Store (Had previous debt before using this system)

| Field | Value | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Opening Balance | 15,000 | Customer already owed 15,000 from before |
| Total Sales | 100,000 PKR | New sales in this system |
| Total Payments | 80,000 PKR | Customer paid 80,000 |
| **Closing Balance** | **35,000 PKR (Red)** | Old debt + new sales - payments |

**Calculation:** 15,000 + 100,000 - 80,000 = **35,000 PKR**

---

### Example 3: Customer Who Overpaid
**Customer:** Rahmat Shop (Paid more than they owe)

| Field | Value | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Opening Balance | 0 | Started fresh |
| Total Sales | 25,000 PKR | Made sales worth 25,000 |
| Total Payments | 30,000 PKR | Customer paid 30,000 (advance) |
| **Closing Balance** | **-5,000 PKR (Green)** | YOU owe customer 5,000 |

**Calculation:** 0 + 25,000 - 30,000 = **-5,000 PKR**

**What this means:** Next time this customer buys something, adjust by reducing 5,000 from their payment.

---

### Example 4: Fully Settled Customer
**Customer:** Kareem Store

| Field | Value | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Opening Balance | 10,000 | Had old debt of 10,000 |
| Total Sales | 40,000 PKR | Made new sales |
| Total Payments | 50,000 PKR | Paid everything including old debt |
| **Closing Balance** | **0 PKR (Black)** | All settled up! |

**Calculation:** 10,000 + 40,000 - 50,000 = **0 PKR**

```
üî¥ RED (Positive number)     ‚ûú  Customer owes YOU money
   Example: 20,000 PKR       ‚ûú  They need to pay you 20,000

üü¢ GREEN (Negative number)   ‚ûú  YOU owe customer money
   Example: -5,000 PKR       ‚ûú  You owe them 5,000 (advance)

‚ö´ BLACK (Zero)              ‚ûú  All clear, no debt
   Example: 0 PKR            ‚ûú  Everything is settled
```

## üìù How to Set Opening Balance When Adding Customer

### Scenario A: Brand New Customer
```
Name: New Customer
Opening Balance: 0
```
No previous history, start fresh.

---

### Scenario B: Customer with Old Debt
**Customer previously owed you 8,000 PKR (from before system)**

```
Name: Old Customer
Opening Balance: 8000
```

Now when they make purchases:
- Make a sale of 10,000 PKR
- Receive payment of 5,000 PKR
- **Closing Balance:** 8,000 + 10,000 - 5,000 = **13,000 PKR** (They owe you)

---

### Scenario C: Customer with Advance Payment
**You took 3,000 PKR advance from customer before system**

```
Name: Advance Customer
Opening Balance: -3000
```

Now when they make purchases:
- Make a sale of 10,000 PKR
- Receive payment of 5,000 PKR
- **Closing Balance:** -3,000 + 10,000 - 5,000 = **2,000 PKR** (They still owe you)

**Note:** The advance (-3,000) gets adjusted automatically.

## üéØ Common Questions

**Answer:** 
1. Check their closing balance (e.g., 20,000 PKR)

4. Their closing balance becomes 0 PKR
