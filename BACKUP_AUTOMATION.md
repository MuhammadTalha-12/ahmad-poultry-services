# Automated Data Backup System

## üéØ Overview

The Ahmad Poultry Services application now includes a comprehensive automated backup system to protect your valuable business data. This system creates backups in both Excel (for human viewing) and JSON (for automated restoration) formats.

## üìã Backup Contents

Each backup includes complete data from all models:

- **Customers** - All customer information, balances, and status
- **Daily Rates** - Historical cost and sale rates
- **Purchases** - All purchase transactions
- **Sales** - All sales records with customer details
- **Payments** - Payment history for all customers
- **Expenses** - All business expenses

## üöÄ How to Create Backups

### Method 1: Frontend UI (Easiest)

1. Login to the application: https://ahmad-poultry-services.netlify.app
2. Go to the **Dashboard** page
3. Scroll to the **Data Backup** section
4. Click the **"Download Backup"** button
5. Your backup will download as an Excel file with a timestamp

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No technical knowledge required
- ‚úÖ Works from anywhere

- ‚úÖ Detailed console output

### Method 3: API Endpoint

**Using cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ahmad-poultery-backend.onrender.com/api/backup/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -o backup.xlsx
```

**Using Python:**
```python
import requests

url = "https://ahmad-poultery-backend.onrender.com/api/backup/"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
with open("backup.xlsx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

## ‚è∞ Automated Backup Scheduling

### Windows - Task Scheduler

1. **Create Backup Script (`backup.bat`):**
```batch
@echo off
cd "D:\Ahmad Poultry Services\backend"
call .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python manage.py backup_data
echo Backup completed at %date% %time% >> backup_log.txt
```

2. **Open Task Scheduler:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, press Enter

3. **Create Basic Task:**
   - Click "Create Basic Task"
   - Name: "Ahmad Poultry Backup"
   - Description: "Daily backup of database"
   - Trigger: Daily at 2:00 AM
   - Action: Start a program
   - Program: `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
   - Arguments: `/c "D:\Ahmad Poultry Services\backend\backup.bat"`

4. **Advanced Settings:**
   - Run whether user is logged on or not
   - Run with highest privileges
   - Configure for: Windows 10

### Linux/Mac - Cron Job

1. **Create Backup Script (`backup.sh`):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py backup_data
echo "Backup completed at $(date)" >> backup_log.txt
```

2. **Make Script Executable:**
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

3. **Edit Crontab:**
```bash
crontab -e
```

4. **Add Cron Job:**
```bash
# Daily backup at 2:00 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/backend/backup.sh

# Every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * /path/to/backend/backup.sh

# Every Monday at 3:00 AM
0 3 * * 1 /path/to/backend/backup.sh

# First day of every month at 1:00 AM
0 1 1 * * /path/to/backend/backup.sh
```

### Production (Render.com)

For the deployed backend on Render:

1. **Option A - Render Cron Jobs (Paid Plans):**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Create a new Cron Job
   - Command: `python manage.py backup_data`
   - Schedule: `0 2 * * *` (Daily at 2 AM)

2. **Option B - External Scheduler:**
   - Use a service like [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)
   - Create a job that calls your backup API endpoint
   - Set authentication headers
   - Schedule as needed

3. **Option C - GitHub Actions:**

Create `.github/workflows/backup.yml`:

```yaml
name: Database Backup

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Backup
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.BACKEND_URL }}/api/backup/ \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}" \
            -o backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).xlsx
      
      - name: Upload to Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: database-backup
          path: backup_*.xlsx
          retention-days: 30
```

### JSON File Structure

```json
{
  "backup_timestamp": "20251029_143022",
  "backup_datetime": "2025-10-29T14:30:22.123456+00:00",
  "data": {
    "customers": [...],
    "daily_rates": [...],
    "purchases": [...],
    "sales": [...],
    "payments": [...],
    "expenses": [...]
  },
  "counts": {
    "customers": 26,
    "sales": 150,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Complete database structure
- ‚úÖ Preserves all relationships
- ‚úÖ Can be used for automated restoration
- ‚úÖ Machine-readable format

## üîÑ Data Restoration

### From Excel (Manual)
- Open Excel file
- Review and manually re-enter data if needed
- Useful for spot-checking specific records

### From JSON (Automated)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This will overwrite existing data. Use with caution!

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py loaddata backups/ahmad_poultry_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

**Better Approach - Selective Restoration:**

```python
# Create a custom management command for safe restoration
import json
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from sales.models import Customer, Sale, Purchase, Payment, Expense

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        with open('backup.json', 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
        
        # Restore only specific models or records
        # Add your custom restoration logic here
```

## üìÖ Backup Retention Strategy

### Recommended Schedule

1. **Daily Backups** - Keep for 7 days
   ```bash
   0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
   ```

2. **Weekly Backups** - Keep for 4 weeks
   ```bash
   0 3 * * 0 /path/to/backup.sh && cp backup.xlsx weekly_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).xlsx
   ```

3. **Monthly Backups** - Keep for 12 months
   ```bash
   0 4 1 * * /path/to/backup.sh && cp backup.xlsx monthly_backup_$(date +%Y%m).xlsx
   ```

### Automatic Cleanup Script

**cleanup_old_backups.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/backups

# Delete backups older than 7 days (except weekly and monthly)
find . -name "ahmad_poultry_backup_*.xlsx" -mtime +7 ! -name "weekly_*" ! -name "monthly_*" -delete

# Delete weekly backups older than 28 days
find . -name "weekly_backup_*.xlsx" -mtime +28 -delete

# Delete monthly backups older than 365 days
find . -name "monthly_backup_*.xlsx" -mtime +365 -delete

echo "Cleanup completed at $(date)"
```

**Schedule cleanup:**
```bash
# Run cleanup daily at 3:00 AM
0 3 * * * /path/to/cleanup_old_backups.sh
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Backup Files:**
   ```bash
   chmod 600 backups/*.xlsx  # Read/write for owner only
   chmod 600 backups/*.json
   ```

2. **Never Commit Backups to Git:**
   - Backups are already gitignored
   - Double-check `.gitignore` includes `backups/`

3. **Encrypt Sensitive Backups:**
   ```bash
   # Using GPG
   gpg --encrypt --recipient your@email.com backup.xlsx
   
   # Using 7-Zip with password
   7z a -p backup.7z backup.xlsx
   ```

4. **Store Offsite:**
   - Upload to Google Drive (encrypted)
   - Use Dropbox with encryption
   - Store on external drive in different location
   - Use cloud storage with versioning

5. **Access Control:**
   - Only admin users can create backups via API
   - Restrict access to backup directory on server
   - Use strong passwords for encrypted backups
